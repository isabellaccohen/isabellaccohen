	<h1>Sisterhood</h1>
<p>Sigma Chapter engages in so many sisterhood events over the course of the year! Because of these events, I have built relationships and bonds that will last a lifetime. Some of these sisterhood events include: </p>
<ul> Big Little Reveal</ul>
<ul>Cooking Classes</ul>
<ul>Paddle Reveal</ul>
<ul>Retreats</ul>
	<ul>Philanthropy Events </ul>
<ul>And so many more!</ul>
<h2>Big Little Reveal</h2>
<p>One of the many ways we build friendships across pledge classes is by assigning big little pairings and having a reveal event each fall. In the week leading up to reveal, the newest PC receives baskets from their bigs full of AEPhi clothes and their favorite snacks. My big little reveal was Halloween themed and my little and I dressed up in matching costumes! </p>

<h2>Paddle Reveal</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and most exciting chapter traditions is paddle reveal. Each year, the newest pledge class decorates paddles and gives them to their bigs to show how much they appreciate all the hard work they put into making awesome baskets for big little week and that they love being part of a family (phamily). It is always a fun event and gives the two pledge classes a chance to catch up after a long winter break. Here's my paddle that my little designed for me!</p>
