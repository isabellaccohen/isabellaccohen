<h1>History of AEPhi</h1>
<p>Alpha Epsilon Phi was founded by seven Jewish women, Helen Phillips, Ida Beck, Rose Gerstein, Augustina "Tina" Hess, Lee Reiss, Rose Salmowitz and Stella Strauss, at Barnard College in New York City on October 24, 1909. Their goal was to foster lifelong frienship and sisterhood, academics, social involvement and community service while providing a home away from home for their members.</p>

	<h1> About Sigma Chapter</h1>
<p>Alpha Epsilon Phi Sigma Chapter is a close-knit group of over 200 women who attend UW-Madison. We pride ourselves on our national core values of beauty, strength, and wisdom, but also value our own individual characteristics that make our chapter unique. Our members work hard to present our chapter to the Greek community and the university in a positive light. Our members are part of countless professional and service organizations outside of Sigma as well, and we are proud to have the highest overall sorority GPA on campus.</p>
