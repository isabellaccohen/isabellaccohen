<h2>This website is all about my sorority, AEPhi, here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</h2>
		<p>Alpha Epsilon Phi is a sorority dedicated to helping women become the best they can be. We prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique. We welcome exemplary women of all backgrounds who honor, respect, and appreciate our heritage.</p>
<p>Being apart of this amazing sisterhood, I have made amazing and lifelong friendships. Everyday, I am surrounded by beautiful women who inspire and encourage me to reach my full potential. I could not have asked for a better place to call home and I will cherish the memories I have made forever.</p>
